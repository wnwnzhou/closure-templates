## What are Closure Templates? ##

Closure Templates are a client- and server-side templating system that helps you dynamically build reusable HTML and UI elements. They are easy to learn and customizable to fit your application's needs. Closure Templates support JavaScript and Java and use a data model and expression syntax that works for either language. You can also use the built-in message support to easily localize your applications.


## What are the benefits of using Closure Templates? ##

  * **Convenience**. Closure Templates provide an easy way to build pieces of HTML for your application's UI and help you separate application logic from display.

  * **Language-neutral**. Closure Templates work with JavaScript or Java. You can write one template and share it between your client- and server-side code.

  * **Client-side speed**. Closure Templates are compiled to efficient JavaScript functions for maximum client-side performance.

  * **Easy to read**. You can clearly see the structure of the output HTML from the structure of the template code. Messages for translation are inline for extra readability.

  * **Designed for programmers**. Templates are simply functions that can call each other. The syntax includes constructs familiar to programmers. You can put multiple templates in one source file.

  * **A tool, not a framework**. Works well in any web application environment in conjunction with any libraries, frameworks, or other tools.

  * **Battle-tested**. Closure Templates are used extensively in some of the largest web applications in the world, including Gmail and Google Docs.
